// TODO: audio doesn't always play if it's already been played in the other watch it/try it tab [Dev browser issue? Incognito window seemed to clear it up]
// TODO: "how to use" overlay
// TODO: make the continue button show up when there's no trigger (and/or no audio?)
// TODO: entering formula lesson, try it restarts watch it [narrower window problem, translation/position issue]
// TODO: last step audio is playing twice (if you click before the audio is done) [fixed?]
// TODO: delay hint in case it's an impending double-click
// TODO: support iPad for interaction (double-click, hover, etc)
// TODO: support drag-and-drop, text interaction

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// DONE: make text boxes green
// DONE: animate text boxes
// DONE: animate button
// DONE: add pointer arrows to callout (library function?)
// DONE: narration
// DONE: stop audio when changing steps
// DONE: hint/error messages
// DONE: interactivity types (click, double-click, hover, drag and drop, text, no-delay, etc)
// DONE: watch versus try
// DONE: "watch" mode: cursor
// DONE: "click", "double-click" effect
// DONE: watch/try buttons
// DONE: figure out how to style the target boxes
// DONE: end of lesson screen (fade out?)
// DONE: reset "hinted" class (during render? update?)
// DONE: click Prev/Next leaves tweens running?
// DONE: Hotspot and Mousetrail aren't always initialized with the correct scale [changed Step.didUpdate; maybe that fixed it?]
// DONE: don't hard-code path for loading player data
// DONE: trigger step notifications (for the Framework highlighting)
// DONE: convert Markdown for steps
// DONE: don't replay audio during resize [replays from start if it hasn't finished playing yet]
// TODONT: still not aligning boxes correctly on resize [I think this is fixed now]
// DONE: renamed Player to player
// DONE: size to fit available area (even for non-4x3 background images)
// DONE: enter for watch it
// DONE: show an ENTER key animation
// DONE: only send current step when "started"
// DONE: start cursor over at center of screen
// DONE: BUG: when repeating task, last arrow is not in the right place
// DONE: hold image on last step when done
// DONE: show "Watch It" or "Try It" on the play screen
// DONE: text input
// DONE: text input for Watch
// DONE: hotspots are still not sized correctly on initial load [visibility]
// DONE: delay mouse based on audio (may have to wait for audio to load to determine duration)
// DONE: separate callout text for interactive side [shortText; entered as text, html would require more work]
// DONE: are the arrows supposed to be offset to point to the exact spot?
// DONE: server publishing [ManageIt? No: Google Drive]
// DONE: callout widget -> Habitat [icon for Pattern]
// DONE: started refactor without React.js
// DONE: pause on resize
// DONE: repeat step audio if unpausing when it hasn't played completely
// DONE: set the "finished" value for a task when it's complete
// DONE: stop timers when pause is hit
// DONE: "none" trigger supported
// DONE: text input [re-done but untested]
// DONE: scaling
// DONE: make sure previous/next advance step text (on left)
// DONE: hitting play when finished (ie, repeat overlay button is visible) needs to replay task
// DONE: hide rectangles when not started or paused
// DONE: keep last screenshot visible when finished
// DONE: animate.css still seemed to trigger after I'd hit pause [now hidden when paused]
// DONE: overlay play button should just resume not start over
// DONE: re-playing try didn't have textboxes in the right place [step.positionText, removing animated classes may have helped]
// DONE: arrows are not always showing up (covered by textbox)
// DONE: after repeat button, pause button state isn't correct
// DONE: on Safari, Enter graphic isn't centered correctly [-webkit prefix required for transforms]
// DONE: on Safari, scaling (ie, click) transforms don't seem to work
// DONE: when finished, clicking on steps leaves the last image visible
// DONE: "continue" trigger [or is "None"] sufficient? [none]
